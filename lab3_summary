I used border radius to make a rounded corner box around social media icons
I used border image on the footer, to make a background border with an image
I used border-shadow to get a shadow around the wrapper/website
Text shadow is on the footer text
On the form page I added multiple backgrounds, one is the gray background and the other one is a backgrounnd image a person.
I used a gradiant background on the header of my pages.
In the images page I created a lightbox, using hover effects over my images and
adding explanations to them. Using 4 images.  
In my main page I added a free font , "Hello, welcome to my fitness page."
I made a start page, where I used the full screen background image slide show, then I added a start button that takes us to the main navigational page. 
For the lightbox, in the images page I used the hover effect on each image to add a title and extra details about the image. 
I added a menu transition on the home page.
For the 2d transform, If you hover over the work hard image in the form page, it moves to the side.
For my one more advanced css3 feature I decided to add a background video. It is the video page.
